            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>My name is Mikayla Martin and I am a full stack developer.
                I took a bootcamp through the Ohio State University for full stack developement and it has furthered
                my love for programming and computers. All my life I've loved the styling side of coding and through this
                program I have learned so much about front and back end, and I hope to continue to grow and learn more 
                in the future.
            </p>
